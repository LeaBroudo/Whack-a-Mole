# Whack-a-Mole

This is a web-based game of Whack-A-Mole that I made using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. During the game, different moles will pop out of holes at random intervals, and your job is to whack as many as you can by clicking them with your mouse! After a 60 second game, you have the opportunity to replay the game. Happy Whacking!
